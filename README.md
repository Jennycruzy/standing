# Standing

Standing remembers why a code decision was made and checks whether the facts it depended on still hold.

## Phase 1: memory

Sibyl Memory is the local store behind Standing. It is a database file on the machine, not a separate service.

- Decisions, conditions, and observer histories are written in [`standing/memory.py`](standing/memory.py#L41).
- A fresh process reads them through the same file at [`standing/memory.py`](standing/memory.py#L47).
- Decisions governing changed files are found by path at [`standing/memory.py`](standing/memory.py#L148).
- Archive and restore use the real Sibyl client plus its documented restore fallback at [`standing/memory.py`](standing/memory.py#L163).
- The memory-off test uses the same interface and starts with a new empty store at [`tests/test_memory.py`](tests/test_memory.py#L75).

The direct Python client is installed with:

```sh
uv pip install --python .preflight-venv/bin/python sibyl-memory-client==0.8.0
```

Run the Phase 1 tests with:

```sh
.preflight-venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

The local memory database is ignored by Git. Secrets remain in the environment and are never written into memory records.

## Decision evaluation

The pure evaluator is [`standing/evaluator.py`](standing/evaluator.py#L101). It checks only the four supported rules, returns `STANDS`, `EXPIRED`, `UNKNOWN`, or `CONTESTED`, and produces a repeatable fingerprint for the result.

Only `EXPLICIT` and `CONFIRMED` conditions can block. An `INFERRED` or `EXTERNAL` condition remains visible as a note but cannot stop a change. The evaluator never reads files, calls a model, or writes to memory.

The complete test count is 18. Run it with:

```sh
.preflight-venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```
